# Grapher

A small java project for displaying graphs.

# Creating a new graph

To create a new graph, start the program, navigate to the folder you want to save the graph in, and type [name].mbgraph in the name selector box. The file does not have to exist for the graph to be saved. The .mbgraph extension is not enforced, but it should of course be used for these files whenever possible.

# Editing the graph

Currently, most things are edited via right-click (partly positional), but the following keyboard controls are available:

CTRL + S - Save (to rename or move a graph, close the program and move the file manually)

CTRL + F - Search (this isn't a good ui yet, sorry. You have to press Search once before you can type your query.)

I want to make the keyboard shortcuts customizable in the future, but for now, they will be hardcoded.
